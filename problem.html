					<h3>Energy Conservation With Modern Technology</h3>
					<p>
						The world’s natural resources are already depleting, and people are
						starting to feel the repercussions of a wasteful lifestyle. As such,
						energy conservation is vital in today’s world.In order to conserve
						energy we need to keep a check on all the type of resources that are
						being used in our day to day life. With IoT it becomes easy to track
						the resources we are using and we can monitor and keep a check on.
						Reports generated from such monitoring system can help in conserving
						natural resources and reduce unnecessary wastage if any. We would
						like you to develop a mobile/web app system using IoT to make energy
						conservation easy. Also provide reports on usage of all the
						resources in day to day life and smart automation methods to reduce
						the amounts of any resource we use.

						teacher has to decide wheather the method of teaching is indeed
						capable of the understanding of a student. On that note we want you
						to surf in to the future and find out the solutions that may lead to
						intellectual well being of the next generation.
